# Security Policy
## Reporting a Vulnerability
When reporting a vulnerability, please try and give as much detail as possible:
1. What is the vulnerability
2. How the vulnerability was found
3. How to replicate the bug/vulnerability
4. Any possible steps that could be taken to patch the vulnerability.

To report a non-serious security vulnerability, please post in the discussions section.<br>
Discussions are checked at least once every 24 hours

**When reporting a serious vulnerability such as a zero-day, please email me directly at: isaacljubic@valency.dev.**<br>
**Emails are checked at least once every 8 hours**<br>

## Security Vulnerability Contribution Rewards
Further down the line with funding, we would like to set up a bug bounty system that rewards these contributors.<br><br>
**We appreciate all help we can get :)**
